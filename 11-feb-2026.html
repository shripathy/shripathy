          <p>
            The last time I wrote something, the internet convinced me to quit my
            previous job, which was 8 years ago, and I'm forever grateful to those
            internet anons.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know what motivated me to write this (along with Claude, of
            course), but I felt like the internet is putting a lot of pressure on
            SDEs right now. I feel like this is an outlet for me to calm myself,
            and in that process, if you can take anything away, that's an extra W
            for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            The title is something that most of you would've heard, and it's true
            for any human in anything in life. But here, I'm focusing on how
            half-baked influencers and some big CEOs say software engineering is on
            its way to death. So let me jump right into it.
          </p>

          <h2>A Confession I'm Not Proud Of</h2>

          <p>
            I need to tell you something uncomfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's a category of work that every engineering team has. The kind
            nobody fights for in sprint planning. Migrating a config format.
            Writing test cases for a module nobody's touched in two years.
            Stitching together API endpoints that follow a pattern you've built a
            hundred times before. For years, that work went to the newest person
            on the team. Not as punishment, but as education. You can't understand
            a system by reading the wiki. You understand it by getting your hands
            dirty in the parts nobody glamorizes. That's where you learn why a
            field is nullable, why that retry logic exists, why there's a comment
            that says "DO NOT CHANGE THIS" with no further explanation. Those
            small, unglamorous tasks were the real onboarding.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I don't hand out that work to people anymore. I hand it to an
            LLM.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The output is faster, more consistent, and I don't have to block two
            hours for a walkthrough. On paper, it's a pure efficiency win.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I've started asking myself a question I don't have a comfortable
            answer to: <em>if nobody does the grunt work, how does anyone build
            the instinct that comes from doing it?</em>
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            Every week, a new headline tells you software engineers are finished.
            AI can code now. Pack it up. Learn plumbing. Start considering
            alternative livelihoods.
          </p>

          <p>
            And every week, I watch the same AI tools hallucinate a dependency
            that doesn't exist, generate a perfectly structured service that
            ignores our business logic.
          </p>

          <p>
            So let me save you the anxiety spiral: <strong>AI is not going to
            replace software engineers.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what nobody's telling you. It's already replacing a
            specific type of software engineer. <strong>The one who only knows how
            to write code.</strong> And if that sentence doesn't make you even
            slightly uncomfortable, you're either very senior or very asleep.
          </p>

          <h2>The Real Threat Isn't AI. It's the Gap It's Creating.</h2>

          <p>
            Our industry has always had its fault lines. In 2015, the big split
            was front-end versus back-end. In 2020, it was product engineers
            versus infra specialists. In 2025, the divide is between "AI-aligned"
            and everyone else. This time, the gap isn't about what you build. It's
            about whether you're seen as part of the future or part of the cost to
            cut.
          </p>

          <p>
            The distribution of skill in our industry is starting to look like a
            barbell, and the weight is all at the extremes.
          </p>

          <p>
            On one side, you've got the veterans. People who've shipped systems
            that handled unprecedented traffic, who've been paged at 3 AM because a
            config change cascaded into a full outage, who've spent a decade
            collecting the kind of scars that no tutorial can simulate. These
            people are using AI the way a seasoned carpenter uses a nail gun.
            They're faster, but their judgment about where to aim hasn't changed.
            They know what to ask for, and more critically, they can smell when the
            output is wrong before they even run the tests.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other side, you've got people who can orchestrate an LLM into
            producing a working app in an afternoon but have never traced a memory
            leak or reasoned about what happens when two threads hit the same
            resource. They ship fast. They look productive. But the moment
            something breaks in a way the model hasn't seen, they're stuck.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The middle is where growth used to happen.</strong> You'd write
            something, a senior would rip it apart in review, you'd feel the
            sting, and you'd never make that mistake again. That feedback loop is
            what turned average developers into good ones. It was slow, sometimes
            painful, and completely irreplaceable.
          </p>

          <p>
            That loop is fracturing. When I review a person's code, we have a
            conversation. I can explain not just what's wrong but why it matters,
            what it would look like at scale, what happened the last time someone
            made this exact mistake in production. The person on the other end
            walks away with context they'll carry for years. When I look at
            AI-generated code and it's wrong, I adjust the prompt. The output
            might improve. But nobody on the other end absorbed anything. There's
            no scar tissue forming. No instinct being built. Just a marginally
            better response to a marginally better prompt.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We're accumulating codebases full of logic that works today but that
              no single person on the team deeply understands. Entire services
              written by a model, reviewed quickly because they "looked right,"
              and shipped because the deadline was yesterday. That's not a
              productivity revolution. That's a slow-moving trust problem wearing
              the disguise of efficiency.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Why Software Engineers Are More Exposed Than They Realize</h2>

          <p>
            Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, wrote an essay called
            <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace" target="_blank"><em>"Machines of Loving Grace"</em></a> that most engineers should read
            but few have. His central argument is that AI will transform different
            industries at wildly different speeds, and the bottleneck isn't
            intelligence. It's the physical world.
          </p>

          <p>
            In healthcare, AI might be able to design a breakthrough drug in
            hours, but clinical trials still take years. In manufacturing, an AI
            can optimize a supply chain overnight, but building the factory still
            takes eighteen months. In agriculture, biology, energy... the atoms
            move slowly even when the bits move fast.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Software has no such buffer.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Our entire industry operates in bits. Code in, code out. No clinical
            trials. No physical prototypes. No regulatory waiting periods. The
            feedback loop is instant. So when AI gets good enough, the disruption
            hits software engineering first and hardest. While a hospital is still
            running trials on an AI-designed drug, our industry will have already
            absorbed three generations of AI tooling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amodei asks a question in his essay that should haunt every developer:
            <em>if AI removes the need for basic labour, what happens to the entry
            ramp?</em> He's talking about developing nations losing their
            comparative advantage when automation replaces cheap manufacturing.
            But the parallel to our industry is chilling. If AI removes the need
            for basic coding labour, the entry ramp for Junior Developers narrows
            the same way.
          </p>

          <p>
            And here's the part that non-IT industries should be paying attention
            to: they're not immune. They just have a longer fuse. Software
            engineers are the canaries in the coal mine. How we adapt, or fail to,
            will be the playbook (or the cautionary tale) for every other industry.
          </p>

          <h2>The Trap of "Keeping Up"</h2>

          <p>
            Now here's the irony. I just told you to skill up. To learn systems,
            to deepen your domain knowledge, to invest in the things AI can't
            replicate. And the first thing most people do after reading advice like
            that is open Twitter, subscribe to three more AI newsletters, and
            start drowning in the firehose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last week, two major model releases dropped within twenty minutes of
            each other. The week before, a new video generation tool apparently
            "changed everything." The week before that, something else came out
            that I genuinely can't even remember. This is every single week now.
            New models, new tools, new benchmarks, new articles telling you that
            if you're not using <em>this</em> right now, you're already behind.
          </p>

          <p>
            That low-grade pressure never fully goes away. And it's by design.
          </p>

          <p>
            The AI content ecosystem runs on urgency. Every creator, every
            newsletter, every Twitter thread gets more reach when a release sounds
            like the biggest thing in history. "This changes everything" performs.
            "This is a marginal improvement for most people" doesn't. So the
            volume is always at ten, even when the actual impact is a three.
          </p>

          <p>
            And here's the psychology: every new release you haven't tested yet
            doesn't feel like an opportunity. It feels like a loss. Your brain
            processes "I might be missing out" roughly twice as intensely as
            "cool, a new option." Multiply that by three releases a week and you
            get a specific kind of paralysis. People who know an enormous amount
            about AI but haven't actually built anything meaningful with it.
            Bookmarked threads pile up. Subscriptions run simultaneously. Prompt
            packs collect dust.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Keeping up with AI does not mean knowing every model the day it
              drops, having an opinion on every benchmark, or testing every tool
              within the first week. That's consumption, not competence.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Keeping up means having a filter that answers one question:
            <strong>does this matter for my work?</strong> Yes or no. A new video
            generation model is irrelevant unless you're in video production. A
            coding-focused model release doesn't matter unless you ship code
            daily. Half of what drops in any given week has zero impact on your
            actual workflow.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engineers who look "ahead" aren't consuming more. They're
            consuming dramatically less, but the <em>right</em> less. They pick
            one or two tools, go deep, and ignore the rest until it proves itself
            relevant. That discipline is a skill in itself, and it might be the
            most underrated one in this entire conversation.
          </p>

          <h2>The Part Nobody Wants to Hear</h2>

          <p>
            I want to be honest with you, because I think you deserve honesty over
            comfort.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Not everyone is going to make it.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>The One Advantage Software Engineers Have</h2>

          <p>
            Here's the thing that gives me genuine hope, and it's something I
            haven't seen anyone else write about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Non-IT industries don't have the culture to adapt to this. A hospital
            can't "move fast and break things." A bank can't ship AI-generated
            risk models without months of regulatory approval. Traditional
            industries are built on process, compliance, and institutional inertia.
          </p>

          <p>
            Software engineering is the opposite. Our industry has been
            reinventing itself every five years for decades. We went from waterfall
            to agile. From monoliths to microservices. From on-prem to cloud. From
            REST to GraphQL. Every time, the people who adapted thrived, and the
            people who clung to the old way got left behind.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>That adaptability is the skill.</strong> Not any specific
            framework or language, but the muscle memory of reinvention itself. We
            are the one industry that is culturally built for exactly this kind of
            disruption. But only if we choose to exercise that muscle instead of
            freezing.
          </p>

          <h2>So, Will AI Replace Software Engineers?</h2>

          <p>
            No. But the definition of "software engineer" is being rewritten right
            now, in real time, and you're either holding the pen or you're watching
            it happen to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engineers who treat AI as a colleague rather than a threat, who
            invest in the skills AI genuinely cannot replicate, will come out
            ahead. They'll be faster, sharper, and more valuable than any previous
            generation of developers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engineers who assume their current skill set is enough, who dismiss
            the urgency, who think "this too shall pass"... they're the ones the
            headlines are actually about.
          </p>

          <p>
            And the companies that decided new graduates are an expense they can
            optimize away? They're going to look around in five years and realize
            they have a room full of tools and nobody left who learned how to
            think.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The ladder isn't broken. It's being rebuilt. But only by the
            people who decided to pick up the tools.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
